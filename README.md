# Books Search App

The project uses FastAPI to communicate with Google's Book API. You can provide a query parameter and receive back a consistent structure for book data.

To start the API server locally, run the following:
```
cd api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Once started, you can see the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
